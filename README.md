🛡️ BioLoc-ZKP: The Biometric FortressBioLoc-ZKP is a next-generation security infrastructure that treats the human body as a permanent, non-transferable cryptographic key. By combining Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) with a 60-factor Neuro-Mechanical behavioral engine, it eliminates the risks of credential theft and profile poisoning.🌌 OverviewTraditional security relies on what you know (passwords) or what you have (tokens). BioLoc-ZKP secures access based on who you are and how you behave. It creates a "Cognitive Firewall" that verifies human intent and physical identity without ever storing a raw password or biometric template in the cloud.🛠️ Core Security Architecture1. The Cognitive Firewall (AI Intent Layer)Before biometric verification begins, users must pass a tiered conversational challenge.Dynamic Traps: Generates technical "trap" questions based on the user's professional role to filter out automated bots.Agentic Verification: Requires high-level collaboration with external AI tools to prove "Agentic Intent" for high-security clearance.2. Zero-Knowledge Identity (ZKP Layer)Identity is verified using Pedersen Commitments ($C = g^v \cdot h^r \pmod p$), ensuring the server never learns your secret phrase.Replay Protection: Every proof is mathematically bound to a unique, server-side generated nonce.Privacy First: Uses cryptographic hashing (SHA-256 with per-user salts) to ensure raw secrets never touch the database.3. The 60-Factor Behavioral EngineA "Straight" (non-adaptive) model that analyzes 60 unique neuro-mechanical markers.Mechanical DNA: Analyzes keystroke timing, flight variance, and hand syncopation.Peripheral Jitter: Tracks mouse movement curvature, jitter indices, and scroll acceleration.Robotic Rejection: Automatically denies access if the typing rhythm is too uniform (Consistency Score < 0.02), effectively blocking script-based attacks.🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesNode.js v18+Firebase Project (Firestore & API keys)Environment Variables: Create a .env.local file with the following:PlaintextNEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key
